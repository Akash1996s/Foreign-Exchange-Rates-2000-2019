# Foreign-Exchange-Rates-2000-2019
This datasets were generated on the Federal Reserve's Download Data Program. Some changes were made in the dataset, such as header simplifications and inversions of base currency. For example, Fed provides Australian Dollar, Euro, New Zeland Dollar and United Kingdom Pound based in their units (not in dollar). So I made a convertion for this dataset in order to view all rates based in dollar units.
